The RFID Attendance Tracking System with NodeMCU is an innovative Internet of Things (IoT) project designed to streamline and automate attendance management processes. This project utilizes an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) scanner to scan RFID cards and records attendance data directly into a Google Sheet through the NodeMCU board.
The system consists of several components working together seamlessly. Firstly, the NodeMCU, which is a powerful IoT development board based on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, acts as the central hub of the project. It connects to the internet via Wi-Fi and communicates with the RFID scanner and the Google Sheets API.

The RFID scanner, equipped with an RFID reader module, is responsible for reading the unique identification information stored on RFID cards. When a user places their RFID card within the scanner's range, it captures the card's ID and sends it to the NodeMCU for processing.

The NodeMCU receives the RFID card ID from the scanner and then establishes a connection with the Google Sheets API. It authenticates the connection using appropriate credentials and grants access to the designated Google Sheet. This ensures secure and authorized data transmission.

Once the connection is established, the NodeMCU writes the attendance data, such as the card ID, timestamp, and any additional relevant information, directly to the designated Google Sheet. The Google Sheets API provides a seamless integration, allowing real-time updates and maintaining a centralized attendance record accessible from any authorized device with internet connectivity.

The project's benefits include enhanced accuracy and efficiency in attendance tracking, elimination of manual data entry, and easy accessibility of attendance records. Additionally, the integration of IoT technology reduces the need for physical presence during attendance management, making it ideal for various environments such as schools, workplaces, or events.

Overall, the RFID Attendance Tracking System with NodeMCU exemplifies the power of IoT and automation in streamlining processes. By leveraging RFID technology and Google Sheets integration, it offers a reliable and efficient solution for attendance management, saving time and resources while ensuring accurate record-keeping.
